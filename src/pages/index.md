  title: What is LEAAD
  description: >
     In the fifteen plus years since our founding, the LEAADS Centers & Foundation has played a major role in the transformation of youth programming in Snellville, Georgia from a city with very little out of school time youth centered resources and activities. 
description: >-
  In an effort to combat youth from getting into trouble the LEAADS Centers & Foundation created and implemented valuable structured programs; such as the After School Academic Prep, Summer Camps, Girls Code Too Mentor Project (partnership with GA Tech), Black Youth Build(Youth Entrepreneur & Financial Literacy) and Youth Employment Training & Placement Programs which incorporates a variety of Culturally Relevant Curriculums which “empowers and promotes positive self identity, values, healthy habits,financial literacy, entrepreneurship, community service and education – resulting in real life transferable leadership and life skills in and outside of the classroom.”

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
